# ðŸš€ Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with Arduino  

This project uses an **Arduino Uno** and an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to measure distances and provide visual feedback via LEDs. The sensor readings are displayed in the **Serial Monitor**, while two LEDs blink alternately as the detected distance decreases. A power module is also included for external power supply.  

## ðŸ›  Features  
- âœ… Ultrasonic distance measurement using **HC-SR04**  
- âœ… LED indication based on proximity  
- âœ… Real-time distance readings in the **Serial Monitor**  
- âœ… Efficient timing using `millis()` instead of `delay()`  
- âœ… Simple and lightweight code  

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Requirements  
- **Arduino Uno**  
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**  
- **2 LEDs + Resistors**  
- **Breadboard & Jumper Wires**  
- **External Power Module (optional)**  

## ðŸ“œ Usage  
- Upload the provided code to your **Arduino Uno**.  
- Connect the **HC-SR04** sensor to the appropriate pins:  
  - **Trig â†’ D9**  
  - **Echo â†’ D10**  
- Connect the LEDs to digital pins (e.g., **D6 & D7**) via resistors.  
- Power up the circuit using **USB or an external power supply**.  
- Open the **Serial Monitor** to observe the real-time distance readings and LED behavior.  

ðŸ“Œ *Refer to the circuit diagram for proper wiring.*
